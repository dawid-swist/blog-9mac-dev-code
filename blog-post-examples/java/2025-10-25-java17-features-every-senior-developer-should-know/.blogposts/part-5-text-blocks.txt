🚀 Java 17 Features Every Senior Developer Should Know - Part 5: Text Blocks

Part 5 of 6 - Essential Java 17+ features for senior developers upgrading from Java 8, 11, or 13.

⚠️ This is a teaser article. Quick introduction to text blocks, the problem they solve, and simple examples. Read the full article for indentation rules, escape sequences, and 15+ practical examples with JSON, SQL, HTML, and XML.

💡 Why This Matters

If you've ever embedded JSON, SQL, HTML, or XML in Java, you know the pain:

    // Before Java 15: String concatenation hell
    String json = "{\n" +
                  "  \"name\": \"Alice\",\n" +
                  "  \"age\": 30,\n" +
                  "  \"email\": \"alice@example.com\"\n" +
                  "}";

Every line needs the + operator, manual \n escapes, and quote escaping with \". Copy-paste a JSON object from a tool? Good luck reformatting it.

Text Blocks (Java 15) solve this: write multi-line strings the way you'd write them in any other language.

🔍 What are Text Blocks?

A text block is a multi-line string literal delimited by triple-double-quotes ("""):

    // Java 15+: Text blocks - clean and readable
    String json = """
        {
            "name": "Alice",
            "age": 30,
            "email": "alice@example.com"
        }
        """;

No escape sequences. No concatenation. No ceremony. The compiler automatically handles line breaks and indentation.

Before and After:

    // Before: Noisy and error-prone
    String sql = "SELECT u.name, u.email\n" +
                 "FROM users u\n" +
                 "WHERE u.active = true\n" +
                 "ORDER BY u.created_at DESC";

    // After: Readable as actual SQL
    String sql = """
        SELECT u.name, u.email
        FROM users u
        WHERE u.active = true
        ORDER BY u.created_at DESC
        """;

✨ Key Insight

Text blocks eliminate one of Java's longest-standing pain points: working with embedded languages (JSON, SQL, HTML, XML). They make strings readable by letting you write data the way you'd write it outside of Java code.
