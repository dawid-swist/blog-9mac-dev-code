Java 17 Features Every Senior Developer Should Know - Part 5: Text Blocks

Part 5 of 6 - Essential Java 17+ features for senior developers upgrading from Java 8, 11, or 13.

**This is a teaser post.** Quick intro to the feature, the problem it solves, and simple examples. Read the full article for indentation rules, escape sequences, and 15+ practical examples with JSON, SQL, HTML, and XML.

**Why This Matters**

If you've ever embedded JSON, SQL, HTML, or XML in Java, you know the pain:

```
// Before Java 15: String concatenation hell
String json = "{\n" +
              "  \"name\": \"Alice\",\n" +
              "  \"age\": 30,\n" +
              "  \"email\": \"alice@example.com\"\n" +
              "}";
```

Every line needs the `+` operator, manual `\n` escapes, and quote escaping with `\"`. Copy-paste a JSON object from a tool? Good luck reformatting it.

Text Blocks (Java 15) solve this: **write multi-line strings the way you'd write them in any other language.**

**What are Text Blocks?**

A **text block** is a multi-line string literal delimited by triple-double-quotes (`"""`):

```
// Java 15+: Text blocks - clean and readable
String json = """
    {
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 30,
        "email": "alice@example.com"
    }
    """;
```

No escape sequences. No concatenation. No ceremony. The compiler automatically handles line breaks and indentation.

**Before and After**

```
// Before: Noisy and error-prone
String sql = "SELECT u.name, u.email\n" +
             "FROM users u\n" +
             "WHERE u.active = true\n" +
             "ORDER BY u.created_at DESC";

// After: Readable as actual SQL
String sql = """
    SELECT u.name, u.email
    FROM users u
    WHERE u.active = true
    ORDER BY u.created_at DESC
    """;
```

**Key Insight**

Text blocks eliminate one of Java's longest-standing pain points: working with embedded languages (JSON, SQL, HTML, XML). They make strings readable by letting you write data the way you'd write it outside of Java code.
