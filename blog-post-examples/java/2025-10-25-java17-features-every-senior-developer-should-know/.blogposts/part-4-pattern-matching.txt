🚀 Java 17 Features Every Senior Developer Should Know - Part 4: Pattern Matching & Switch Expressions

Part 4 of 6 - Essential Java 17+ features for senior developers upgrading from Java 8, 11, or 13.

⚠️ This is a teaser article. Quick introduction to pattern matching, the problems they solve, and examples. Read the full article for pattern matching in other languages, guards, and 10+ scenarios.

💡 Why This Matters

Before Java 16, checking types required redundant, mechanical code:

    // Pre-Java 16: The instanceof-cast ceremony
    if (obj instanceof String) {
        String s = (String) obj;  // Manual cast required
        return "String of length " + s.length();
    } else if (obj instanceof Integer) {
        Integer i = (Integer) obj;  // Same pattern repeated
        return "Integer: " + i;
    }

You write String three times in a single branch. The pattern is mechanical and error-prone.

Switch statements were even worse—they encouraged fall-through bugs and forced variable mutation:

    // Pre-Java 14: Classic switch with fall-through danger
    switch (month) {
        case "January":
        case "March":  // Forgot break? Silent bug.
            days = 31;
            break;
        default: throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    }

Pattern matching and switch expressions solve both problems.

🔍 What is Pattern Matching?

Pattern matching combines type checking and variable binding in a single operation:

    // Modern way with pattern matching (Java 16+)
    if (obj instanceof String s) {
        return "String of length " + s.length();  // s is already String
    }

No redundancy. No extra casts. The compiler automatically checks the type, casts, and binds the variable s.

Switch Expressions:

Before Java 14, switch was a statement (didn't return values). Modern switch is an expression:

    // Modern way: switch expression (Java 14+)
    var days = switch (month) {
        case "January", "March", "May" -> 31;
        case "February" -> 28;
        case "April", "June" -> 30;
        default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    };

Arrow syntax (->) eliminates fall-through. No break statements needed.

✨ Key Insight

Pattern matching represents a paradigm shift from imperative (how do I check and cast?) to declarative (what pattern should match?). Combined with sealed classes, it enables exhaustive checking at compile-time.
