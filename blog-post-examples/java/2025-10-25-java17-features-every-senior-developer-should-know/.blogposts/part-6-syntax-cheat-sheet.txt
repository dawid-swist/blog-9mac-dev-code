🚀 Java 17 Features Every Senior Developer Should Know - Part 6: Quick Reference

Part 6 of 6 - Final installment of the Java 17+ features series.

⚠️ This is a teaser article. Quick introduction to the syntax cheat sheet. Read the full article for complete reference with syntax, migration checklist, and troubleshooting guide.

💡 Why This Reference Matters

Throughout this series, we've explored six major Java 17 features. But switching between multiple long articles to remember syntax is inefficient. Senior developers need a single, printable reference they can keep at their desk.

Part 6 provides a complete syntax cheat sheet for all 6 features:
• Quick syntax for all features
• When to use each feature
• Common pitfalls and gotchas
• Migration checklist
• Combined example showing features working together

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔍 What's in the Full Reference

The complete Part 6 article includes quick-reference sections for:

1. var keyword - Type inference syntax and rules
2. Records - Declaration, compact constructors, validation
3. Sealed Classes - Sealed syntax, permits clause, three modifiers
4. Pattern Matching - instanceof patterns, type patterns, guards
5. Switch Expressions - Arrow syntax, yield, exhaustiveness
6. Text Blocks - Triple quotes, indentation, escape sequences

Plus:
• Real-world combined example showing all features together
• Step-by-step migration checklist for upgrading from Java 8
• Troubleshooting guide for common compiler errors
• Performance tips and best practices

✨ Key Insight

A good cheat sheet isn't a replacement for deep understanding—it's a tool for efficient recall. After reading the full series, you'll return to Part 6 frequently: during code review, when mentoring, during migrations, or when you need to remember exact syntax.
