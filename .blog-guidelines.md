# General Blog Guidelines for blog.9mac.dev

## Hard Rules

### Working Directory Constraints
1. Work ONLY within assigned directory for each project
2. Do NOT access, read, write, or modify files outside the project directory
3. Communication with user: POLISH language only
4. ALL PRODUCTION (blog posts, code, comments, documentation, variable names): ENGLISH only
   - Blog post markdown files: English
   - Source code: English
   - Code comments: English
   - JavaDoc/ScalaDoc: English
   - Variable/method/class names: English
   - Unit test names and assertions: English
   - README files: English

## Project Context

### Build System
- Uses Gradle build system (Gradle 9.0.0)
- Build command: `./gradlew build` (from repository root)
- Test command: `./gradlew test`

### Directory Structure
- Individual projects organized by date (e.g., `2025-10-25-project-name/`)
- Each project may have its own `build.gradle`
- Package naming: `dev.nmac.blog.examples.*`
- `.blogposts/` directory for generated blog posts (excluded from git)

## Target Audience
- Senior developers updating their knowledge
- New programmers learning modern technologies
- Developers preparing for practical use

## Content Requirements
- Detailed description of each feature/concept
- Code examples with various combinations
- Professional but accessible language
- Each example: code block + unit test + explanation
- Avoid common examples from other blogs
- Include practical use cases
- Repository links for readers to clone and run

## Blog Post Format (MANDATORY)

Each example in blog must follow this structure:

1. **Concept description** (2-3 sentences)
2. **Code block** with `main()` method showing usage
3. **Code block** with unit tests using `@DisplayName` (BDD style)
4. **Output section** showing program output
5. **Key Insight** explaining the concept

### Example Structure:

```java
// Concept description
public class ExampleClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Usage demonstration
        System.out.println("result");
    }
}
```

```java
// Unit tests
@Test
@DisplayName("Should demonstrate feature behavior")
void shouldDemonstrateFeatureBehavior() {
    // Test with assertions
}
```

**Output:**
```
program output here
```

**Key Insight:** Explanation of the concept

## Strict Rules for Blog Posts

- **NO** exercises/practice sections (blog post, not tutorial)
- **NO** "Happy coding!", "Try it yourself", etc.
- Source code: detailed comments + `@DisplayName` tests
- Blog post: concise, focused on demonstrating features

## File Organization

- Blog posts stored in `.blogposts/` directory as markdown files
- Full working code in project directory
- Concise examples
- Unit tests demonstrating API usage in single code blocks

## Reference Materials

Always verify information against official documentation and authoritative sources like:
- Official language/framework documentation
- Almanac sites (e.g., javaalmanac.io)
- JEP (Java Enhancement Proposal) documents
- Official RFC/specification documents
