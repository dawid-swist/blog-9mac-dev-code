# General Blog Guidelines for blog.9mac.dev

## Hard Rules

### Working Directory Constraints
1. Work ONLY within assigned directory for each project
2. Do NOT access, read, write, or modify files outside the project directory
3. Communication with user: POLISH language only
4. ALL PRODUCTION (blog posts, code, comments, documentation, variable names): ENGLISH only
   - Blog post markdown files: English
   - Source code: English
   - Code comments: English
   - JavaDoc/ScalaDoc: English
   - Variable/method/class names: English
   - Unit test names and assertions: English
   - README files: English

## Project Context

### Build System
- Uses Gradle build system (Gradle 9.0.0)
- Build command: `./gradlew build` (from repository root)
- Test command: `./gradlew test`

### Directory Structure
- Individual projects organized by date (e.g., `2025-10-25-project-name/`)
- Each project may have its own `build.gradle`
- Package naming: `dev.nmac.blog.examples.*`
- `.blogposts/` directory for generated blog posts (excluded from git)

## Target Audience
- Senior developers updating their knowledge
- New programmers learning modern technologies
- Developers preparing for practical use

## Content Requirements
- Detailed description of each feature/concept
- Code examples with various combinations
- Professional but accessible language
- Each example: code block + unit test + explanation
- Avoid common examples from other blogs
- Include practical use cases
- Repository links for readers to clone and run

## Blog Post Format (MANDATORY)

Each example in blog must follow this structure:

1. **Concept description** (2-3 sentences)
2. **Code block** with `main()` method showing usage
3. **Code block** with unit tests using `@DisplayName` (BDD style)
4. **Output section** showing program output
5. **Key Insight** explaining the concept

### Example Structure:

```java
// Concept description
public class ExampleClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Usage demonstration
        System.out.println("result");
    }
}
```

```java
// Unit tests
@Test
@DisplayName("Should demonstrate feature behavior")
void shouldDemonstrateFeatureBehavior() {
    // Test with assertions
}
```

**Output:**
```
program output here
```

**Key Insight:** Explanation of the concept

## Strict Rules for Blog Posts

- **NO** exercises/practice sections (blog post, not tutorial)
- **NO** "Happy coding!", "Try it yourself", etc.
- Source code: detailed comments + `@DisplayName` tests
- Blog post: concise, focused on demonstrating features

### Writing Style - CRITICAL

**Avoid marketing/promotional language:**
- ❌ "elegant", "beautiful", "powerful", "shine"
- ❌ "This feature saves the world" / "game-changer"
- ❌ Flowery adjectives: "perfectly", "wonderfully", "incredibly"
- ❌ Superlatives that oversell the feature

**Use professional, technical tone:**
- ✅ "Sealed classes restrict inheritance to explicitly named types"
- ✅ "The compiler enforces exhaustiveness in pattern matching"
- ✅ "Records are implicitly final, suitable for sealed implementations"
- ✅ Direct descriptions of what the feature does, not hyperbole about impact

**Style principles:**
- Technical accuracy over marketing appeal
- Clear, concise descriptions of functionality
- Avoid repeating the same concept multiple times
- Focus on practical use cases, not hype
- Readers are experienced developers - they don't need salesmanship

## File Organization

- Blog posts stored in `.blogposts/` directory as markdown files
- Full working code in project directory
- Concise examples
- Unit tests demonstrating API usage in single code blocks

### Teaser Articles

For larger series (3+ articles), create teaser versions in TWO formats:

#### 1. Markdown Teasers (`.md`)

**Naming convention:** `part-N-{title}-teaser.md`

**File location:** `.blogposts/` directory

**Intro line (replace "This is a teaser article"):**
Instead of generic disclaimers, use substantive content description:
- ✅ "The `var` keyword eliminates redundant type declarations, letting the compiler infer types from context. This article explores type inference rules, best practices, and shows why it's essential for modern Java development with the Stream API."
- ❌ "This is a teaser article. Quick intro and simple example."

**Teaser structure:**
1. **Series context intro** - Explain this is part of a series, target audience (senior devs), what the series covers
2. **Substantive content description** - What problem the feature solves and what readers will learn
3. **"Why This Matters" section** - Historical context, problem statement, inspiration from other languages
4. **Basic concept explanation** - What the feature is with code examples
5. **When to use** section - Practical guidance with ✅ (do) and ❌ (don't) examples
6. **Real-world examples** - 2-3 comprehensive code examples (HTML, SQL, JSON, etc.)
7. **Advanced patterns** - Additional patterns and use cases
8. **Key Insight** - One sentence summarizing the feature's value
9. **Call-to-action** - Link to full article with bullet list of topics

**Markdown teaser guidelines:**
- **No character limit** (dev.to accepts long-form articles)
- Extensive code examples (4+ detailed examples)
- Include advanced patterns beyond basic usage
- Professional tone matching full articles
- GitHub repository clone instructions at bottom
- Every teaser links to corresponding full article with `[BLOG_LINK_HERE]` placeholder

**Purpose:** dev.to publication
- Standalone, in-depth articles
- Long-form educational content
- Can contain many code examples
- Includes advanced patterns

#### 2. LinkedIn-Ready Posts for Social Media (`.txt`)

**Naming convention:** `part-N-{title}.txt`

**File location:** `.blogposts/` directory

**Format:** Plain text, ready for direct copy-paste to LinkedIn

**LinkedIn formatting rules:**

1. **Emoji for sections:**
   - 🚀 Title/intro
   - ⚠️ Disclaimer/context
   - 💡 Why This Matters
   - 🔍 What is [Feature]
   - 💻 Code examples
   - ✨ Key Insight
   - 📖 Call-to-action with link
   - 👉 Links
   - 👇 Engagement question at end

2. **Separators:** `━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━` (exactly 24 Unicode characters) between sections

3. **Markdown removal:** NO `**bold**`, `#headers`, `` `backticks` ``, ` ``` `code blocks` `

4. **Code formatting:**
   - Indent 4 spaces (no backticks)
   - One blank line before code
   - One blank line after code
   - Preserve comments // at end of lines

5. **Bullet points:**
   - `•` for regular lists
   - `✅` for benefits/CTA items

6. **Whitespace:**
   - Blank line between paragraphs
   - Blank line before/after separators
   - Blank line before/after code blocks

7. **Links:**
   - All at bottom in "Read the Full Article" section
   - Format: `👉 Full article: [BLOG_LINK_HERE]`
   - Format: `💻 GitHub code: [REPO_URL]`

8. **Call-to-action:**
   - Engaging question with `👇` emoji
   - Blank line before CTA
   - Blank line after CTA

9. **Hashtags:**
   - 5-7 hashtags
   - CamelCase for multi-word tags
   - Bottom of post (last line)

**LinkedIn teaser guidelines:**
- **Character limit:** Max 3300 characters (LinkedIn safe limit)
- Shorter than markdown version (condensed)
- No complex examples (only simple demonstrations)
- High readability: short paragraphs, emoji, separators
- Engagement-focused CTA
- GitHub repo reference with clone instructions

**Example LinkedIn structure:**
```

#### Relationship Between Formats

| Aspect | `.md` (dev.to) | `.txt` (LinkedIn) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|

**Process:**
1. Write markdown teaser first (comprehensive)
2. Condense to LinkedIn version (engagement-focused)
3. Both link to full article with `[BLOG_LINK_HERE]` placeholder
4. Replace placeholder with actual URL after publication

## Reference Materials

Always verify information against official documentation and authoritative sources like:
