## How to Use This Repository

Each directory in this repository will typically correspond to a specific blog post or a series of related posts. Within each directory, you will find the code examples relevant to that article.

To get started:

1.  **Browse the directories:** Look for a directory that matches the title or topic of the blog post you are interested in.
2.  **Explore the code:** Each directory will contain the necessary source files and potentially a `README.md` file with specific instructions or information about the examples.
3.  **Run the code:** Follow the instructions provided in the individual directory's `README.md` (if available) or the comments within the code to run the examples.


## Repository structures

* **[blog-post-examples/scala/](blog-post-examples/scala/)**: Explore code examples and projects related to the Scala programming language. This includes various series and articles covering different aspects of Scala development.

* **[blog-post-examples/java/](blog-post-examples/java/)**: Find practical Java code snippets and projects. This section covers fundamental Java concepts, advanced topics, and integrations with other technologies.
